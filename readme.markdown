# mcan.sh

This is my [website](https://mcan.sh). It's pretty simple.

## Running Locally

Get the source:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mcansh/mcan.sh
$ cd mcan.sh
```

Get the dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Now you can start the server:

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser to see it running.
